# '=' is used to assign the value to a variable whereas '==' is used to compare the value of two variable
# comparision results in boolean represented as True and False ( case sensitive)
# in python every object or variable has a boolean representation  eg 0,{},[],None represent 'False'

x = 'abc'
print('abc' == x)

if x == 'abc':
    print('Its True')
else:
    print('Its False')
